# Changes in feature lib product-configurator 

## _configurator-add-to-cart-button.scss

`.cx-add-to-cart-btn-container` is enhanced with new styling information in order to display the quantity that
is used for adding configurable products to the cart.

## _configurator-form-group.scss

New styling for `.cx-required-error-msg ` has been added.

# Changes in feature lib pickup-in-store

## _index.scss
Removed `$useLatestStyles: true;`.
This led to the disregard of the configured feature level for the pickup-in-store library.
